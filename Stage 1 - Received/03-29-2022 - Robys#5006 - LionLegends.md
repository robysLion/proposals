1. Proposal summary
  
  1.1 I propose Boss DAO utilizes 5-6k ADA to sweep both LionLegends And LionLegends Lioness floor. With Lions having 914k ADA volume in Jpg.store, Lionesses - 172k.
      If spending 3k ada on Lions now - it would raise its floor price from 49 to 95 as of this date.
      If spending 3k ada on Lionesses now - it would raise its floor price from 35 to 60 as of this date.

2. Proposal details
  
  2.1 As I said i propose Boss DAO utilizes 5-6k ADA to sweep both LionLegends and LionLegends Lioness floor. 
      This ADA can be spread out and be 2.5k to Lions and 2.5k to Lionesses.
      LionLegends season 1 has 5555 NFT supply, season 2 (Lionesses) have 5555 NFT supply.

  2.2 With that LionLegends also has almost none to nothing listen compared to these numbers and other projects.
      As there is only 410(7%) Lions listed, and 523(9%) Lionesses listed. So with the sweeping happening the floor will rise drastically.

  2.3 What do we get from this sweep?
      Lions and Lionesses will be stakeable, so we will be able to receive tokens.
      We could be able to change this into ADA.

  2.4 Starting on Quarter 2 - they will introduce breeding. When breeding SZN1 and SZN2 those both will be burned to receive 1 3D avatar usable in metaverse.
      This will be a supply shock. With demand being in place, supply getting lower and lower automatically will raise the floor price of both season 1 and season 2.
      
  2.5 So once breeding comes out, as I said supply will get lower, we will be able to sell at a higher price not only Lions and Lionesses, but the accumulated tokens
      that we got in the meantime.
